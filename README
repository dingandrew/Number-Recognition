In the numClass.py file the code is divided by lines of "#########" each code
section should be a seprate cell when writing in a python notebook.

The purpose of the numClass.py file is to download the dataset an prepare it for
the neural network. Then we build the neural work and train it using the dataset.
After we are done training our model, we test it and examine its accuracy.


The purpose of the numReader.py file is to load the model we trained in 
numClass.py, and take images from eithier webcam or zumi which will be 
processed and fed into the model.
